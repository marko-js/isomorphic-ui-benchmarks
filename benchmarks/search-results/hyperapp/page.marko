        <!--
        In order for behavior to be attached to the
        React UI components rendered on the server, we must re-render the
        SearchResults UI component _again_ on the client using the exact same
        data that we used to render it on the server.
        This means that we have to go through the expensive step of
        serializing the data to JSON and add the data to the page (increases
        the page weight). The re-rendering on the client happens in "./client.js"
        and it uses the data assigned to the global variable produced
        by the following inline script:
        -->
        <script>
            window.searchResultsData=${JSON.stringify(input.searchResults)};
        </script>
    </@body>
</include>
